### Title : Experiment 1 UML-use-case-diagram

### Aim : To design UML use case diagram

### Theory : 
A use case is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role of an actor and a system to achieve a goal. A use case is a useful technique for identifying, clarifying, and organizing system requirements. A use case is made up of a set of possible sequences of interactions between systems and users that defines the features to be implemented and the resolution of any errors that may be encountered.While a use case itself might drill into a lot of detail (such as, flow of events and scenarios) about every possibility, a use-case diagram can help provide a higher-level view of the system, providing the simplified and graphical representation of what the system must actually do.A use case (or set of use cases) has these characteristics:Organizes functional requirements,Models the goals of system/actor (user) interactions,Describes one main flow of events (main scenarios) and possibly other exceptional flows (alternatives), also called paths or user scenarios.

### Explanation : Benefits of Use Case Diagram
1. Use cases is a powerful technique for the elicitation and documentation of black-box functional requirements.

2. Because, use cases are easy to understand and provide an excellent way for communicating with customers and users as they are written in natural language.

3. Use cases can help manage the complexity of large projects by partitioning the problem into major user features (i.e., use cases) and by specifying applications from the users' perspective.

4. A use case scenario, often represented by a sequence diagram, involves the collaboration of multiple objects and classes, use cases help identify the messages (operations and the information or data required - parameters) that glue the objects and classes together.

5. Use cases provide a good basis to link between the verification of the higher-level models (i.e. interaction between actors and a set of collaborative objects), and subsequently, for the validation of the functional requirements (i.e. blueprint of white-box test).

6. Use case driven approach provides an traceable links for project tracking in which the key development activities such as the use cases implemented, tested, and delivered fulfilling the goals and objectives from the user point of views.

### How to Draw a Use Case Diagram? A Use Case model can be developed by following the steps below.

1. Identify the Actors (role of users) of the system.

2. For each category of users, identify all roles played by the users relevant to the system.

3. Identify what are the users required the system to be performed to achieve these goals.

4. Create use cases for every goal.

5. Structure the use cases.

6. Prioritize, review, estimate and validate the users.
